# Etch-a-Sketch

A simple browser-based drawing application inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. 
This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) Foundations curriculum, 
designed to reinforce core JavaScript, HTML, and CSS concepts through hands-on practice.

## üß† Project Goals

- Practice DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Use event listeners effectively
- Work with CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Build interactive UI elements (e.g., buttons for clearing or resizing the grid)

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Draw by hovering over a grid of squares
- Clear the sketch with a reset button
- Adjust the size of the grid dynamically
- Optional: Toggle between different coloring modes (e.g., black, random color, eraser)

## üß± How It Works

1. A grid is dynamically created using JavaScript.
2. Event listeners detect mouse interactions (mouseover) on grid squares.
3. CSS classes are toggled or modified to change square appearance.
4. Users can reset or resize the grid through interactive buttons.
